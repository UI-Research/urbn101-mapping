# Review 

* Making maps in R is really powerful and easy
* The `sf` package handles point and polygon spatial data
* sf objects are dataframes with an additional geometry column

```{r, warning=F, message=F, eval = T}
library(urbnmapr)
library(urbnthemes)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tigris)
set_urbn_defaults(style = "map")
```



# Reading in spatial data

 Out in the wild, spatial data comes in many formats but some of the common ones you will encounter are:

* CSV's with lon/lat columns
* GeoJSON's (.geojson)
* Shapefiles (.shp)

the `sf` package has a function called `st_read()` that makes reading in any of these types of files easy.

<font color="#ec008b"> For GeoJSONs and Shapefiles:</font>

```{r, eval = F}
data <- st_read("path/to/geojson/file.geojson")
data <- st_read("path/to/shp/file.shp")
```

<font color="#ec008b"> For CSV's:</font>

```{r, eval = F}
# You have two options!
# 1- Read in the file using st_read, but maniupulate some GDAL options
data <- st_read("path/to/csv/file.csv",
  options = c("X_POSSIBLE_NAMES=lon", "Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES=lat")
)

# 2- Read in the file as a data frame and convert it to an sf object
data <- read_csv("path/to/csv/file.csv")
data <- st_as_sf(data, coords = c("lon", "lat"))
```
**NOTE: X = Longitude & Y = Latitude.** You will at some point mix these two up, but try to keep them straight.

`st_read` can also accept URL's!

```{r, eval = T}
data <- st_read("https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/287eaa2ecbff4d699762bbc6795ffdca_9.geojson")
```

Notice that it  figured out what filetype it was and what kind of spatial data it was.


## Exercise 1: Create a Project

<font color="#55b748">**Step 1:**</font> Create a new directory called `mapping101`

<font color="#55b748">**Step 2:**</font> Open RStudio. Click "Project: (None)" in the top right corner. Click "New Project" and create a project based on the existing 'mapping101` directory.

<font color="#55b748">**Step 3:**</font> Open a `.R` script with the button in the top left. Save the script as `01_data-import-export.R`.

<font color="#55b748">**Step 4:**</font> `library()` the following packages into your R session: `sf`, `tidyverse`, `urbnthemes`, `urbnmapr`

## Exercise 2: Read in a GeoJSON

<font color="#55b748">**Step 1:**</font> Read in data on the locations of all fire stations in DC. Create a variable named `fire_stations` and using `st_read`, read in the following GeoJSON from this URL: https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Safety_WebMercator/MapServer/6/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=NAME,ADDRESS,TRUCK,AMBULANCE&outSR=4326&f=geojson

<font color="#55b748">**Step 2:**</font> Type in `fire_stations` into your console and press enter. What does this SF dataframe look like? F

## Exercise 3: Read in a CSV
<font color="#55b748">**Step 1:**</font> Copy and paste the following link into your browser to download the CSV to you computer. It's a dataset on all crimes in DC within the last 30 days.
https://geocoding-codestar-test.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/crime_last_30_days.csv

<font color="#55b748">**Step 1:**</font> Create a folder called `data` in your mapping101 folder, and move the downloaded CSV into that folder

<font color="#55b748">**Step 2:**</font> Find the filepath to the CSV (it should be something like 'data/example.csv') and read it into R as an sf dataframe named `crime_30`. Note: You may need to open the CSV to see what the X and Y columns are labelled as. You can use any of the two methods described above




# Writing out spatial data

sf has a function called `st_write` that can write out sf objects as GeoJSON's, shapefiles, CSVS, Geopackages, or just about any other spatial format supported by [GDAL](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html). We recommend  saving your spatial files as GeoJSON's whenever you can for for a few reasons:

  1) It's a pretty universal file format that can easily be read back into R or other programs like ArcGIS, or Python
  2) It uses standardized projections and naming conventions, which saves you a lot of headaches down the road
  
  
<font color="#ec008b"> Writing out GeoJSONs and Shapefiles: </font>

```{r, eval = F}
st_write(sf_data, "output/path/filename.geojson")
st_write(sf_data, "output/path/filename.shp")
```


<font color="#ec008b"> Writing out CSV's </font>

There may be some cases when you need to write out your spatial data as a CSV and sf does let you do that, but your longitude and latitude columns will be labelled X and Y respectively. If you need to write out CSV's we recommend writing out a WKT (Well Known Text) column instead of X and Y columns because WKT columns can be used to store polygon data, and they use more standard naming conventions that can easily be read into R or other programs. WKT columns represent the same data as X and Y columns but in a slightly different format.

|X|Y|
|-|-|
|-76.9651|38.89204|


|WKT|
|:--|
|POINT (-76.9651, 38.89204)|

And here's how you write out CSV's both ways using `sf_write`:

```{r, eval = F}
# Writing out X and Y columsn to CSV
st_write(sf_data, "C:/Users/anarayanan/Downloads/exparkslocations.csv",
  layer_options = "GEOMETRY=AS_XY"
)

# Writing out WKT columns to CSV
st_write(sf_data, "C:/Users/anarayanan/Downloads/exparkslocations.csv",
  layer_options = "GEOMETRY=AS_WKT"
)
```

## Exercise 4: Writing out Spatial data
<font color="#55b748">**Step 1:**</font> Let's say we were only interested in relatively large fire stations. Use the `filter()` function to limit the `fire_stations` dataframe to stations that have more than 5 trucks (ie `TRUCKS > 5`). Call this filtered dataframe `big_stations`

<font color="#55b748">**Step 2:**</font> Write out the `big_stations` dataframe as a GeoJSON into the `data\` folder we created earlier using `st_write()`. Call the file `big_stations.geojson`.


<font color="#55b748">**Step 3:**</font> Write out the `big_stations` dataframe as a CSV with WKT columns into the `data\` folder we created earlier using `st_write()`. Call the file `big_stations_wkt.csv`.




# Where can I find spatial data?

The `tigris` package in R is a great place to start looking. `tigris` provides spatial data for:

* Census Tracts, Blocks, & Block Groups
* Counties, ZCTA's, PUMA's, Places
* congressinal districts, School Districts
* roads, railways, native areas, military bases
* Lots of other data sources!

It provides powerful functionality by allowing you to filter to specific states, counties, or tracts. Say for example I wanted data on all block groups in DC

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height =3, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}
dc <- tigris::block_groups(
  state = "DC",
  year = 2017,
  class = "sf",
  progress_bar = FALSE
)

ggplot(dc) +
  geom_sf()
```


What about Census tracts in Montgomery County? 

```{r, eval = T}
montco_tracts <- tracts(
  state = "MD",
  county = "Montgomery",
  class = "sf",
  cb = T,
  progress_bar = FALSE
)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = montco_tracts, mapping = aes())
```


Below are some other common places to find spatial data

* [Open Data Portals](https://opendata.dc.gov/)

* [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/documentation/gis-data)




## Exercise 5: Using tigris
<font color="#55b748">**Step 1:**</font> Use the `school_districts()` function in tigris to download all the school districts in Oregon from the year 2015. Call the variable `or_school_districts.` Make sure to set `class = "sf"`!

<font color="#55b748">**Step 2:**</font> Use `ggplot()` and `geom_sf()` to make a plot of all the school districts in Oregon


## Exercise 6: What are projections?

<font color="#55b748">**Step 1:**</font> Download the zipped shapefile of Toronto's zoning boundaries from here: ftp://webftp.vancouver.ca/OpenData/shape/zoning_districts_shp.zip

<font color="#55b748">**Step 2:**</font> Unzip the contents of the shapefile into the `data` folder of the `mapping101` directory.

<font color="#55b748">**Step 3:**</font> Find the filepath to the `zoning_districts.shp` file in the `data` folder and read in the shapefile into R. Name the object `tor_zones`.

<font color="#55b748">**Step 3:**</font> Type `tor_zones` into the column and take a look at
