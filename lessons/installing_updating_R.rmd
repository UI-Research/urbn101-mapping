## When should you update?

All Urban computers should come pre-installed with R and Rstudio. However your R version may be out of date and require updating. We recommend having at least R version 3.6.0 or higher. You can check what version of R you have installed by opening Rstudio and submitting the following line of code to the console: `R.Version()$version.string`.  

If you're working on a personal computer, you may not have R or Rstudio installed. So follow this guide to install both on your computer. 

## Updating R

1) Visit https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/. The latest R version will be the downloadable link at the top. As of 1/1/2020, that R version is 3.6.2. Click on the link at the top and download the `R-x.x.x-win.exe` file. 
2) Open the R-x.x.x-win.exe` file. Click next, accept all the defaults, and install R. After R has been installed, click the Finish button. 

3) Check that your version of R has been updated in Rstudio. If Rstudio is already open, first close it. Then open Rstudio and retype in `R.Version()$version.string`. You should see an updated version number printed out on the console. 


4) Test that R packages are loading as expected. Packages you already had installed should continue to work with newer versions of R. But in some cases, you may need to re-install the packages to work properly with new versions of R. 


## Updating Rstudio
Note you will need admin approval for this if you're updating Rstudio on an Urban computer. If that's the case, just head to helpdesk, tell them you're updating R studio, and ask them to provide an admin password. 


1) Visit https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download and download the appropriate installer for your Operating System. 

2) Open the installer, accept all defaults, and install. Note you will need an admin password for this.
